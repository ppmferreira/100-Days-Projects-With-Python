# Band Name Generator Challenge

Welcome to the  **Band Name Generator Challenge** ! 🎸✨

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a simple yet fun Python project designed to generate creative band names based on user input. The goal is to get familiar with basic Python concepts such as variables, string manipulation, and user input handling.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python 3+

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

* Understanding **variables** in Python
* Using **input()** to take user input
* Concatenating **strings**
* Displaying messages with **print()**

## 🚀 How It Works

The program asks the user two questions:

1. The name of the city they grew up in.
2. The name of a pet they have (or would like to have).

Then, it combines the two inputs to generate a unique band name!

## 📝 Example Output

```
Welcome to the Band Name Generator!
What is the name of the city you grew up in? → New York
What is the name of a pet you have? → Rocky

Your band name could be: New York Rocky! 🎶
```

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Install Python if you haven't already.
2. Copy the Python script (`band_name_generator.py`).
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python band_name_generator.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts and get your band name!

## 📌 Next Steps

* Customize the output with more styling.
* Allow the user to generate multiple band names.
* Save generated names in a file.

Enjoy coding! 🚀
